## Task I (week 1) combinational circuits:

day 1: 

In this video you will implement basic logic gates in the Vivado environment

for learning the theory please reffer the following link :- [click here to redirect to the link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logic-gates/)

Check out this video on YouTube this will get you started with the vivado environment and you will get insights on how the design flow takes place:

day 2:

Create and account at [hdlbits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page)

Solve and upload in your github repo :)

- [Step One](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Step_one)
- [Zero](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Zero)
- [Wire](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Wire)
- [Wire4](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Wire4)


day 3:-

i hope you have completed day 2 as day 3 is dependent on day 2

Prerequisites of TASK-I day 3 are given in the following link [LEARN HOW TO CODE FOR LOGIC GATES](https://github.com/ARX-0/HARDWARE_101/blob/main/prerequisites.md)

the actual task 
- [Wire_decl](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Wire_decl)
- [coding for 7458 chip](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/7458)

## TASK II (sequential circuits)
### HERE WE LEARN AND IMPLEMENT sequential circuits (dificulty is set to medium)

PREREQUISITES :- 

- [watch this vid to get a reason on WHY we need to go into sequential ckts in FPGAs....](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-za84TsjDk)
- [WHAT IS THE "ALWAYS" block and how to code for it...(whyrd-hdlbits)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG9Gr0gYcQA)

day 4:- 

Solve the problems lited below (ONLY AFTER REFFERING TO THE ABOVE VIDS) 
- [prob-1](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Alwaysblock1)
- [prob-2](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Alwaysblock2)

day 5:- 
- ~arrays~ vectors in verilog (key concepts for memory declarations ... RAMs..ROMs may it be segmented or a block if there is a memory there lies a vector).

- [reffer the vid for the intro to vectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4O2BbNW2s&list=PL0E9jhuDlj9qxAfV9hFKNQeHLWimarJJm&index=4)
  - [start by clicking here!](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Vector0)

day 6:-
 Flipflops (memory elements that are essential for the making of sequential circuits)
here you will be offered less help (the upcomming task is a hard task)

- complete the below problems (figure out the answers on your own go on the hunt for resources on your own .... remember "SELF RELIANT" Engineers are paid well and have better job security)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28c3fc3e-5a64-4512-b8a3-1cdb045576fd)

- document what is the difference between a latch and a flip-flop (make it as a readme file understand and importantly understand the key difference)
